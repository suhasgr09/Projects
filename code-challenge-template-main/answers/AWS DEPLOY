For deploying the application on AWS, I will use the following services:

Amazon EC2 (for running the application and database)
Amazon RDS (for running the managed database)
Amazon S3 (for storing the weather data files)
AWS Lambda (for running the scheduled version of the ingestion code)
AWS CloudFormation (for provisioning the infrastructure)
AWS Elastic Beanstalk (for deploying the Flask application)
